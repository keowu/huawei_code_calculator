<h1 align="center"> Huawei Code Calculator </h1>
<p align="center">
Universal calculator to calculate security codes for Huawei products, to obtain privileged access.
</p>

<h2 align="center">About the algorithm</h2>
<p align="center">
The algorithm was extracted from Vivo's router firmware, in which it is blocked for personal use, the algorithm was extracted from a router update, and was analyzed using reverse engineering tools, and reconstructed entirely by me using Ghidra 9.2, as this algorithm is possible to release special access on routers and Huawei products for its generation, the calculation is based on the IMEI with an MD5 hash and a table, when using it remember to use your IMEI correctly to obtain the UNLOCK calculation (If you want to unlock) and FLASH (If you want to extract the contents of the microcontroller), hint the firmware is compacted, use tools like binwalk after reading by pinout using the datasheet.

<h2 align="center">How to run to get your code</h2>
<h3 align="center">With python installed</h3>
<ul align="center">
    <li>1 - Have python installed on your computer, please use version 3.</li>
    <li>2 - Modifique onde possui um coment√°rio dizendo "YOUR IMEI GO HERE"</li>
    <li>3 - To get your IMEI you can look under your router, or if it is a cell phone you can enter the following code on your phone:<strong>*#06#</strong> this is a universal standard used by developers or police to obtain the IMEI unique identification number of your Smartphone / Router.</li>
    <li>4 - After just run normally with (python main.py) and obtain the two keys, the first one from UNLOCK and the second one from Flash.</li>
</ul>
<h3 align="center">Without python installed</h3>
<ul align="center">
    <li>1 - Use an IDE Online, Google is your friend, search for it in the following query "Python 3 IDE ONLINE"</li>
    <li>2 - Copy all content from the main file and paste it into your Online IDE</li>
    <li>3 - To get your IMEI you can look under your router, or if it is a cell phone you can enter the following code on your phone:<strong>*#06#</strong> this is a universal standard used by developers or police to obtain the IMEI unique identification number of your Smartphone / Router.</li>
    <li>4 - After just execute normally pressing the common run button for these types of IDE'S and obtain the two keys, the first one from UNLOCK and the second one from Flash.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center">
And many others, please try even if your device / model is not here and if it works open an issue with the name / model to be added to the list.

<h2 align="center"> How can I contribute?</h2>
<p align="center">Finding more compatible devices and reporting, and leaving a like in my repository and helping with dissemination.</p>

<h2 align="center">Why Python and not C?</h2>
<p align="center">Because I want the algorithm and logic behind it, and I didn't want something big to need to include a good lib of md5 like openssl.</p>

<h2 align="center">I hope this repository is useful for someone with blocking problems, or has been able to exchange knowledge.</h2>
